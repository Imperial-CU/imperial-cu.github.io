                <h3>This I Believe (The Creed)</h3>
                <p>Our Father everlasting, the all creating one: <br /> God Almighty.<br /> Through your Holy Spirit, conceiving Christ the Son: <br /> Jesus our Saviour.</p>
                <p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus</strong><br /> I believe in God our Father,<br /> I believe in Christ the Son,<br /> I believe in the Holy Spirit - <br /> our God is three in one.<br /> I believe in the resurrection - <br /> that we will rise again - <br
                    /> for I believe, in the name of Jesus.</p>
                <p>Our judge and our defender, suffered and crucified;<br /> forgiveness is in you.<br /> Descended into darkness, you rose in glorious life; <br /> forever seated high.</p>
                <p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Bridge</strong><br /> I believe in you.<br /> I believe you rose again.<br /> I believe that Jesus Christ is Lord.<br />(x2)</p>
                <p>I believe in life eternal,<br /> I believe in the virgin birth,<br /> I believe in the saints' communion<br /> and in your holy church.<br /> I believe in the resurrection -<br /> when Jesus comes again -<br /> for I believe, in the name
                    of Jesus.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>
                
                <h3>Amazing Grace</h3>
                <p>Amazing grace! - how sweet the sound<br>
                that saved a wretch like me!<br>
                I once was lost, but now am found;<br>
                was blind, but now I see.</p>
                <p>'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,<br>
                and grace my fears relieved.<br>
                How precious did that grace appear<br>
                the hour I first believed.</p>
                <p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus</strong><br>
                My chains are gone, I’ve been set free!<br>
                My God, my Saviour has ransomed me,<br>
                and like a flood, his mercy reigns.<br>
                Unending love, amazing grace.</p>
                <p>The Lord has promised good to me,<br>
                his word my hope secures.<br>
                He will my Shield and Portion be<br>
                as long as life endures.</p>
                <p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>
                <p>The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,<br>
                the sun forbear to shine,<br>
                but God, who called me here below<br>
                will be forever mine.<br>
                Will be forever mine.<br>
                You are forever mine.</p>

<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus</strong><br>
Bless the Lord, O my soul,<br>
O my soul,<br>
worship his holy name.<br>
Sing like never before,<br>
O my soul,<br>
I’ll worship your holy name.</p>
<p>The sun comes up, it’s a new day dawning;<br>
it’s time to sing your song again.<br>
Whatever may pass, and whatever lies before me,<br>
let me be singing when the evening comes.</p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>
<p>You’re rich in love, and you’re slow to anger,<br>
your name is great, and your heart is kind.<br>
For all your goodness I will keep on singing;<br>
ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.</p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>
<p>And on that day when my strength is failing,<br>
the end draws near and my time has come,<br>
still my soul will sing your praise unending –<br>
ten thousand years and then forevermore.</p>
<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus</strong><br>
Bless the Lord, O my soul,<br>

                <h3>You Alone Can Rescue</h3>
Who, O Lord, could save themselves,<br>
their own soul could heal?<br>
Our shame was deeper than the sea;<br>
your grace is deeper still.<br>
<em>(Repeat)</em></p>
<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus</strong><br>
You alone can rescue, you alone can save,<br>
you alone can lift us from the grave.<br>
You came down to find us, led us out of death.<br>
To you alone belongs the highest praise.</p>
<p>You, O Lord, have made a way,<br>
the great divide you heal,<br>
for when our hearts were far away<br>
your love went further still.<br>
Yes, your love goes further still!</p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bridge</strong><br>
We lift up our eyes, lift up our eyes,<br>
you’re the giver of life.<br>
<em>(x4)</em></p>
<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus</strong><br>
You alone can rescue, you alone can save,<br>
you alone can lift us from the grave.<br>
You came down to find us, led us out of death.<br>
To you alone belongs the highest praise.<br>
To you alone belongs the highest praise.<br>
To you alone belongs the highest praise.</p>

                <h3>In Christ Alone</h3>
                <p>In Christ alone, my hope is found;<br /> he is my light, my strength, my song.<br /> This cornerstone, this solid ground<br /> firm through the fiercest drought and storm.</p>
                <p>What heights of love, what depths of peace,<br /> when fears
                    are stilled, when strivings cease.<br /> My Comforter, my All in All,<br /> here in the love of Christ I stand.</p>
                <p>In Christ alone, who took on flesh – <br /> fullness of God in helpless babe.<br /> This gift of love and righteousness<br /> scorned by the ones he came to save,</p>
                <p>till on that cross as Jesus died,<br /> the wrath of God was satisfied;<br
                    /> for every sin on him was laid – <br /> here in the death of Christ I live.</p>
                <p>There in the ground his body lay,<br /> Light of the world by darkness slain.<br /> Then bursting forth in glorious day,<br /> up from the grave he rose again,</p>
                <p>and as he stands in victory<br /> sin’s curse has lost its grip on me,<br
                    /> for I am his and he is mine,<br /> bought with the precious blood of Christ.</p>
                <p>No guilt in life, no fear in death – <br /> this is the power of Christ in me.<br /> From life’s first cry to final breath,<br /> Jesus commands my destiny.</p>
                <p>No power of hell, no scheme of man<br /> can ever pluck me from his hand.<br
                    /> Till he returns or calls me home,<br /> here in the power of Christ I stand.</p>
