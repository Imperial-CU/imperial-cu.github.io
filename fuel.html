                <p>The splendour of the King<br /> clothed in majesty;<br /> let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice.<br /> He wraps himself in light,<br /> and darkness tries to hide<br /> and trembles at his voice,<br /> and trembles at his voice.</p>

                <p>From age to age he stands<br /> and time is in his hands – <br /> Beginning and the End,<br /> Beginning and the End.<br /> The Godhead, three in one<br /> Father, Spirit, Son,<br /> The Lion and the Lamb,<br /> The Lion and the Lamb.</p>
                <p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>
                <p>Name above all names,<br /> you are worthy of all praise;<br /> my heart will sing: <br /> how great is our God.<br />(x2)</p>

                <h3>In Christ Alone</h3>
                <p>In Christ alone, my hope is found;<br /> he is my light, my strength, my song.<br /> This cornerstone, this solid ground<br /> firm through the fiercest drought and storm.<br /> What heights of love, what depths of peace,<br /> when fears
                    are stilled, when strivings cease.<br /> My Comforter, my All in All,<br /> here in the love of Christ I stand.</p>
                <p>In Christ alone, who took on flesh – <br /> fullness of God in helpless babe.<br /> This gift of love and righteousness<br /> scorned by the ones he came to save,<br /> till on that cross as Jesus died,<br /> the wrath of God was satisfied;<br
                    /> for every sin on him was laid – <br /> here in the death of Christ I live.</p>
                <p>There in the ground his body lay,<br /> Light of the world by darkness slain.<br /> Then bursting forth in glorious day,<br /> up from the grave he rose again,<br /> and as he stands in victory<br /> sin’s curse has lost its grip on me,<br
                    /> for I am his and he is mine,<br /> bought with the precious blood of Christ.</p>
                <p>No guilt in life, no fear in death – <br /> this is the power of Christ in me.<br /> From life’s first cry to final breath,<br /> Jesus commands my destiny.<br /> No power of hell, no scheme of man<br /> can ever pluck me from his hand.<br
                    /> Till he returns or calls me home,<br /> here in the power of Christ I stand.</p>
